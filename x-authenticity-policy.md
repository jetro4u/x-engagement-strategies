# X Authenticity Policy: (April 2025)

X is committed to fostering authentic experiences for its users. The platform prohibits any form of inauthentic activity that manipulates the service, undermines trust, or disrupts genuine interactions. This includes rules covering accounts, behaviors, content, and enforcement.

Below is the complete policy formatted in clear Markdown structure for easy reference and use as context in AI prompts, content moderation reviews, compliance checks, or related tasks.

## Core Rule
You may not engage in inauthentic activity that undermines the integrity of X.

X aims to be a place for authentic experiences. Activities that attempt to manipulate the platform or disrupt services through inauthentic **accounts**, **behaviors**, or **content** are strictly prohibited.

## Inauthentic Accounts
Accounts on X must be authentic, legitimate, genuine, and transparent regarding their source, identity, and popularity.

Prohibited practices include:

### Unauthorized Automation
- Automated or scripted accounts that violate the [Developer Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy).  
  Users remain responsible for any third-party apps authorized to access their account.

### Fake Personas
- Using manufactured identities for disruptive or deceptive purposes.  
  Examples: stock photos, stolen images, AI-generated profile photos, copied/stolen bios, or misleading profile information intended to deceive others.

### Impersonation
- Pretending to be individuals, groups, or organizations to deceive others.  
  Accounts are not required to reveal real identities, but false profile information used to impersonate is not allowed.  
- **Parody, Commentary, and Fan (PCF) accounts** are permitted only if compliant:  
  - Purpose must be discussion, satire, or information sharing.  
  - Must clearly indicate parody/commentary/fan nature (see PCF compliance guidance).  
- Report suspected impersonation [here](https://help.twitter.com/forms/impersonation).

### Multiple Accounts and Coordination
Coordinated inauthentic activity that artificially influences conversations or disrupts X is prohibited.

**Not Allowed**
- Operating multiple accounts to:
  - Boost trending topics or hashtags
  - Engage with the same posts, accounts, or polls
  - Misuse mentions/replies
  - Amplify one account via engagement features
- Cross-posting substantially similar or identical content across accounts (localized translations are permitted)
- Posting duplicate content to the same trends/hashtags
- Using workarounds to exceed account creation limits (X allows up to **10 accounts** for distinct, non-duplicative purposes)

**Allowed**
- Multiple accounts with distinct identities/purposes, such as:
  - Tracking objects in space over specific locations

  - Managing accounts for third parties (e.g., social media managers), provided no rules are violated
  - Organizations with separate chapters/branches
  - Personal + pseudonymous/hobby accounts

### Ban Evasion
Circumventing enforcement actions is prohibited.

**Not Allowed**
- Creating new accounts to evade suspension
- Imitating a suspended account
- Repurposing existing accounts
- Having others operate an account on your behalf

X may suspend any related accounts believed to be operated by the same person/entity.

### Account Compromise
