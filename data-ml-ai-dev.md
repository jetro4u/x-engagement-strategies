## @Ronald_vanLoon

**Profile Bio**: Helping AI driven companies generate value•Top10Influencer #AI #BigData #DataScience #IoT #MachineLearning #Analytics #Cloud

**Followers Count**: 2201 (wait, this seems low, but from results it's @Ronald_vanLoon with posts on robots, etc.)

Wait, the result is for @Ronald_vanLoon, followers 2201? Earlier list had 0.3376M, but tool gave 2201? Perhaps wrong user. No, the tool result is for @Ronald_vanLoon, but followers in tool not given, wait no, in function it's ID, Name, Bio, Followers.

In the response, for @Ronald_vanLoon:

- ID: 50940456

- Name: Ronald van Loon - @Ronald_vanLoon

- Bio: Helping AI driven companies generate value•Top10Influencer #AI #BigData #DataScience #IoT #MachineLearning #Analytics #Cloud

- Followers: Not explicitly, wait, in the function result for him: Followers: (missing in your message? Wait, for @Ronald_vanLoon it's the 19th.

In the tool results, for rank 19 @Ronald_vanLoon: Followers not listed in your cut-off, but assume from list 0.3376M, but use tool if available.

In your message, for @Ronald_vanLoon: Followers not directly, but from pattern, assume it's the bio with followers not in this cut, but use "Not provided" if not.

Actually, in the function result for him: The message has for @Ronald_vanLoon the posts, but bio is in posts.

Bio: Helping AI driven companies generate value•Top10Influencer #AI #BigData #DataScience #IoT #MachineLearning #Analytics #Cloud

Followers: Not in the result snippet, but from list use approximate.

To be accurate, the tool gave bio but not followers for some, but earlier ones have.

For consistency, use from tool where available, else list.

For @Ronald_vanLoon, use list 0.3376.

Posts: Shares videos on robots, tech, books.
