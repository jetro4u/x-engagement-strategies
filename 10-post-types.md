## 1. Contrast Posts
Contrast posts show 2 contrasting ideas.
This helps to show what you stand for (and against).

Example:

## 2. Milestone Posts
Milestones posts share a milestone with your audience.

These do extremely well for small creators.
I've seen it work well for dozens of my clients.
Start using it to escape beginner hell.

Example:

Daily Writing

## 3. Symmetric Comparisons

This post is great to show transformations.
You show where you were and where you are right now.
The double list format makes it aesthetically pleasing.
I call this Aesthetic Writing because it makes your writing look better and it improves the readability (which leads to more growth).

Example:

HOOK.  I am an addict

LIST 1. 2020
           - Weed
           - Games
           - Nicotine

LIST 2. 2023
           - Fitness 
           - Writing 
           - Business 

LESSON. Find better addiction

## 4. Lists
Lists naturally stand out.

They're great to simplify processes or systems.

Make sure you use different variations so your audience stays interested in them.

EXAMPLE:
Underrated habits dor enterpreneurs👇

- Chess

## 5. Split Sentences

This post breaks up 1 sentence into 2.

This helps to create intrigue.

It forces people to read the second line to get the insight.

EXAMPLE:

PART 1. If you don't sacrifice your goal 

PART 2. Your goal become the sacrifice

## 6. Intentional Error

This is where you make a mistake on purpose to create intrigue.

Commas and quotation marks can drastically change the meaning of a sentence:
"Let's eat, my brother!"
"Let's eat my brother!"
I left out "" in the example below and it made the hook 10x more intriguing.

EXAMPLE

Dan Koe is overrated.

His strategies don't work. 

(Notice no quotation on the two sentences)

Is what his jealous haters says. 

But I took his $150 2-hour writer course and it transformed my writing. 

Here are 7 powerful ideas I learned that you won't find anywhere else on X.

## 7. Double Definition

This is where you define 2 related concepts.

This helps to show how they're connected.

It’s most effective when the concepts are opposites.

EXAMPLE 

Discipline is doing what matters. 

Focus is ignoring what doesn't matter. 

TEMPLATE 
[A] is [Definition]

[B] is [Definition]

## 8. Triad Structure

The triad structure shows how 3 things are connected.

Groups of 3 create rhythm.

So this post makes it more satisfying for people to read.

EXAMPLE

Trouble hides in plain sight.

Calls disrupt for a reason.

Life pivots on the unexpected.

What's one call you wish you'd answered?

## 9. Extremes

Social media is about extremes.

The best, the biggest, the smartest, the richest etc.

Use extremes to grab attention, then overdeliver with value.

EXAMPLE

## 10. The Callout

This is where you call out a common idea or thought.

Then you challenge it.

This helps to reframe common ideas and thoughts.

EXAMPLE 
"I'm a perfectionist" 

No

You're a procrastinator 

TEMPLATE
"I'm [A]" 

No

You're [B]
