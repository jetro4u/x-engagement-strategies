# The 12 AI Prompts for X Creators (Summary Reference Guide)

This is a condensed summary of the article "The 12 AI Prompts X Creators Use to Win the Attention Economy" by Jetro Olowole (@JetroOlowole). It explains why most creators stall on X (lack of a signal system optimizing for algorithm predictions like dwell time, replies, and retention) and how system creators compound reach by engineering hooks, authority, depth, and purity. The 12 prompts are categorized to align with X's ranking (predicted user outcomes: stop, read, react, return). Each includes:

- **Copy-paste prompt**: Ready-to-use AI input.
- **Why X rewards this**: Algorithmic benefits (e.g., reduces scroll-past, boosts replies at 13x weight).
- **GEO signal lens**: What it improves (e.g., dwell, originality) and avoids (e.g., redundancy, passive engagement).

Use the loop: Ideate with authority (4–6), hook aggressively (1–3), structure for depth (7–9), sanitize (10–12), and always reply to replies (75x weight). This turns posting into signal engineering for clearer algorithmic favoring.

## CATEGORY 1: Hooks & Angles (Winning the first 2 seconds)

1. **Scroll-Stopper Hook Generator**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Topic: [YOUR TOPIC] Target audience: [WHO THIS IS FOR] Generate 10 opening hooks using these formats: 1. Contrarian take 2. Pattern interrupt 3. Myth-busting 4. Unexpected consequence 5. Sharp one-line question  
   **Why X rewards this**: Reduces early scroll-past rate, stabilizing prediction confidence.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves dwell time, first-second retention, Phoenix confidence calibration. Avoids instant dismiss, low-confidence scoring, early feed suppression.

2. **Common Belief Challenger**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Give me 5 content angles that challenge a common belief in [industry/topic]. Make them sharp but defensible.  
   **Why X rewards this**: Disagreement fuels replies (13x weight over likes).  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves reply probability, conversation depth, out-of-network amplification. Avoids passive engagement, like-only dead ends.

3. **Pattern Extractor (Your Own Winners)**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Here are my last 10 high-performing X posts: [paste posts] Extract the structural pattern behind why they worked. Create a reusable template.  
   **Why X rewards this**: Consistency reinforces author-topic trust and retrieval similarity.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves behavioral consistency, topic authority, embedding coherence. Avoids topic drift, audience confusion, trust decay.

## CATEGORY 2: Research & Ideation (Authority without boredom)

4. **Unusual Stats Finder**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Share recently published, interesting statistics about [topic] that very few people are talking about. Cite sources.  
   **Why X rewards this**: Novel information boosts semantic originality and out-of-network retrieval.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves originality score, citation likelihood, authority adjacency. Avoids redundant takes, content saturation penalties.

5. **Competitor / Influencer Gap Analyzer**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Analyze what [creator/brand] talks about most on X. Identify content gaps or underexplored angles I could own.  
   **Why X rewards this**: Filling gaps positions you as complementary authority, not noise.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves semantic differentiation, network adjacency, discovery probability. Avoids echoing dominant voices, algorithmic redundancy.

6. **Novice vs Expert Filter**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Explain [topic] from: 1. A beginner’s perspective 2. An expert’s perspective 3. A skeptic’s perspective  
   **Why X rewards this**: Multi-perspective framing increases context depth and thread participation.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves thread engagement, reader inclusivity, session length. Avoids one-dimensional posts, narrow audience reach.

## CATEGORY 3: Thread Building (Turning posts into engines)

7. **Modular Thread Builder**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Topic: [TOPIC] Main points: - Point 1 - Point 2 - Point 3 - Point 4 Organize these into a 6–8 tweet X thread with a strong opening and clear flow.  
   **Why X rewards this**: Threads multiply engagement surfaces; replies + author replies compound reach.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves conversation depth, author reply weight, session continuation. Avoids one-tweet ceiling, engagement truncation.

8. **15-Minute Content System**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: My audience is [describe audience]. Ask me their 3 biggest challenges. For each challenge, generate 3 post angles. Create a weekly posting template.  
   **Why X rewards this**: Regular cadence improves behavioral predictability.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves posting consistency, future ranking confidence, audience expectation loops. Avoids sporadic posting penalties, cold-start resets.

9. **Storytelling Intro Transformer**  
   **Copy-paste prompt**: Turn this dry information into a short story for the first 2–3 tweets of a thread: [paste info]  
   **Why X rewards this**: Stories increase dwell and emotional processing for early scoring.  
   **GEO signal lens**: Improves dwell time, scroll depth, memory retention. Avoids skim-and-leave behavior, flat openings.

## CATEGORY 4: Optimization & Repurposing (Winning before scoring even begins)

10. **Performance Rewrite**  
    **Copy-paste prompt**: Rewrite this X post to: - Strengthen the hook - Cut fluff - Improve rhythm - End with a clearer CTA Draft: [paste post]  
    **Why X rewards this**: Cleaner posts reduce negative signals like dismiss or “not interested.”  
    **GEO signal lens**: Improves clarity, engagement probability, completion rate. Avoids scroll fatigue, ambiguity penalties.

11. **Conversation-to-Post Converter**  
    **Copy-paste prompt**: Turn this conversation/transcript into 10 standalone X posts with 8-word max hooks: [paste content]  
    **Why X rewards this**: Natural language converts better than polished prose.  
    **GEO signal lens**: Improves reply likelihood, authenticity signals, shareability. Avoids overproduced tone, spam clustering.

12. **Skeptical Editor (Brutal Mode)**  
    **Copy-paste prompt**: Act as my harshest critic. Identify parts of this post that feel generic, unconvincing, or forgettable. Suggest fixes.  
    **Why X rewards this**: Prevents silent reach killers; negative signals outweigh positives.  
    **GEO signal lens**: Improves signal purity, trust perception, long-term reach stability. Avoids generic phrasing, engagement suppression, algorithmic distrust.
